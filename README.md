# Bundle-method
A project about the bundle method which is a non-differentiable optimization method used a lot in the industry.
For more on the method, a presentation by Prof. Kaisa Joki can be found here http://salserver.org.aalto.fi/vanhat_sivut/tutkijakoulu/ViennaFiles/JokiIIASA.pdf

The pdf file is in French and the code is in Julia, I will try (when I have the time) to upload something in English and a Python code (just for fun).
